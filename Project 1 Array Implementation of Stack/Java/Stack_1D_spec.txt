********************************

I. Input: a text file contains a list of numbers (positive integers). 
       **** The name of the input file should be given in argv[1]

********************************
II. Output: console  

	1) when you push a data on to the stack, write the data to the console,
	one data per text line.

	2) when you pop a data from the stack, write the data to the console
	one data per text line.


********************************
III. Data structure:

  - Stack1D:
	 - top (int)
 	 - StackArry (int*), 1-D integer array, 
			to be dynamically allocated at run time.

     - Stack1D
	- ~Stack1D
	- push
	- pop
	- isEmpty
 			
Algorihtm steps: Write the algorithm steps given in the class below.

Step 0: Create a cpp skelton program, with all the data structures listed above.
	   initalizing all variables, 
	
		count = 0
